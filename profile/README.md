## ABOUT:

This is an adult visual novel set in an original futuristic sci-fi/cyberpunk world.

Continue your romance with your favorite girl (or girls) as you travel across the galaxy, going on all kinds of fun-filled adventures...

## STORY:

Earth has long since been abandoned, and what remains of humanity is now spread out across the galaxy... and so on. If you played **Season 1**, you've heard this already. Anyway, humans left Earth for unknown reasons, and now we're here. But what do *you* care? You have your own problems to deal with.

The climactic battle at **Aeon Station** is over, but not without cost. Now you find yourself racing across the Milky Way, back to the origin of your adventures, to help a friend in need. Will you succeed, or will she **PERISH?** *(She won't perish.)*  

Mysteries will be revealed, and secrets will be uncovered. The universe will decide where your journey takes you, and you need to be ready to explore its depths. *(The universe is huge though, so don't expect to explore all of it.)*
